Simulated
=========
use CreateTranslocations to generate the bam file. (visit the github repository for more info on how to run it) or have a look at the simulation_example.

The config file used to simulate the bam is located in the config_files directory.
The genome was simualated with a coverage of 20x and std insert size 50. Note that only a few chromosomes were simulated(1,2,3,20,21).
Use the generate_bam_file.sh script to generate a bam file similar to the one used in the TIDDIT article
